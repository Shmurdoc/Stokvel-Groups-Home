This project is currently under process. The system is operational but not yet complete. 
The following are the functions that the system should be capable of. 
Please, I am a recent graduate with little to no experience. 
If you find any problems, please make a list or suggest a better method to tackle the problem so that I may improve my skills as a developer.
Your assistance will be much appreciated.

The Idea:

This project is a Stokvels system in which members can join a group that they know and trust. Before the members of this group can successfully join the Stokvel, they will have to fill in some required information. Once they have added the data, the administrator should be able to activate the members account so that they can create or join a group. After joining or creating a group, members must pay the initial deposit for that group as an advance payment. This prepayment will be responsible for missed payments after the member's second offence of not paying the amount owed. The system will have 3 recognized methods of accepting a member which are (platinum, pendingDeposit, paidDeposit). 
Platinum: these are members who have deposited over R100 000.00 in total count from every group joined. These members donâ€™t pay any pre-deposits. They are regarded as trusted members. 
PendingDeposit: these are members who pay what they can and the rest of the payment will be paid together with the stokvel Deposit within the first four ( 4) payments of the first five members depending on length group. 
paidDeposit: these are members who have paid the pre-Deposit for that specific account.
The maximum amount of members in a group is 12 and minimum is 3. 

The system will arrange members using points. The list will be generated in descending order. Members who have pending payments will need to pay within the median of their group member list depending on the length of the group. Only a maximum of 2 members per 6 members will be able to have pending account. Those members will be moved to the end of the list when the stokvel starts.   
Members can join up to two groups at once, either of the same or separate account types.  If a member are unable to pay within the month, their withdrawal will be subject to a penalty cost. If you have already collected your cut and do not want to pay the penalty money, you will be banned. You will then be excluded, and legal action will be taken against the member. when legal action is taken against that member, additional fees will apply.
The purpose of the pre-deposit:
This pre-deposit will be invested after you deposit it the month before the cycle begins. Not all members will be subjected to paying this money. This money is not taxed. Only the money invested is taxed. The money invested will be returned to you together with your dividend, provided you have paid in evenly each month. 30% of your dividend will be deducted from members for use the system.
Chatting areas have been created to avoid members from joining the wrong group. 

Member Ranking done by point: 
- Bronz > R0 < R25 000 

- Silver > R25 000 <R50 000

- Gold > R50 000 <R75 000

- Platnum > R100 000

- PendingPayment: > 0 < Pre-Deposit

4. Up to two groups may be joined by members or created by a group manager. You will receive points for each deposit you make, and the data will be kept under observation. 

5. Before the group leader begins the stokvel, members have the option to join or remove their accounts. Similar to how group leaders have the authority to remove participants before the stokvel begins.

6. Members should be able to converse among themselves and get notifications and messages by using the signalR feature in this system.


7. Each member of the group has a calendar that they may use for personal or collective purposes. you can add daily and weekly activities.

17. The stokvel system will sort members based on point total, starting with the top point earner and working down to the lowest.
To determine whether you are a platinum member, the system will check. Any group can be joined by platinum members without requiring an initial deposit. 
nonetheless, there will be a one-time deposit required for every High Savings Club groups.



Admin:

should be able to accept register accounts after submitting the required paperwork;
Individual members' group activity should be monitorable. 
Should be able to communicate with any group, either privately or inside it.
Users should be allowed to ban accounts, confirm payments, deactivate accounts, change information, freeze stokvel, and resume operations.
Monitor payments and deposits and keep track of each member's history.

Features that have not yet been developed or completed are mentioned in the issues section.
